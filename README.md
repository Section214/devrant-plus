devRant Plus is the spiritual port of my Franz integration to Firefox. Right now it's pretty simple, just tweaking links to open in new tabs if they aren't relevant to devRant itself, adding back buttons to individual rants, and auto-scrolling back to the last viewed rant, but I want it to do much more!

Let me know what you want to see from devRant that isn't officially supported, and I'll see if I can make it happen!
